# GrowGraph Integration Review growgraph-integration-review.sf5-repo-local-integration-review-active-gate-20260529

- Target: `skill:sf5`
- Owner skill: `sf5`
- Verdict: `pass_with_notes`
- Integration allowed: `True`
- AGENTS ref: `AGENTS.md`
- Hook refs: `1`

## Checks

| Check | Status |
| --- | --- |
| `agents_routing_reviewed` | `pass` |
| `agents_owner_boundary_preserved` | `pass` |
| `agents_no_duplication_preserved` | `pass` |
| `hooks_contract_reviewed` | `pass` |
| `hooks_validate_contracts` | `pass` |
| `hooks_block_unsafe_canonical_write` | `pass` |
| `hooks_do_not_force_runtime` | `pass` |

## Findings

- `minor` `review_note`: Repo-local AGENTS.md, workflow and read-only contract gate are present; generated artifacts do not replace source files.

## Next Actions

- review hook/CI enforcement refs
- update GrowGraph adoption report with integration review
- do not claim GGA9 until integration_allowed is true
