# sf5 Repo Mirai Graph Migration

Дата: 2026-05-29

## Scope

Repo-local Mirai Graph companion layer for `skill:sf5`.

This migration does not rewrite `skills/sf5/SKILL.md` and does not move SF5
domain knowledge out of the sf5 skill.

## Result

```text
semantic preservation: pass_with_notes
effectiveness: improved
federation export: success
integration review: pass_with_notes
adoption: GGA9 federation_integrated
contract gate: success
canonical_write_allowed: false
```

## Boundary

This is `GGA9 federation_integrated` for the repo-local companion layer.
It is not `GGA10`; source-of-truth rewrites require a separate approved apply
plan.
